# Template-Structure
First draft of a template structure to use in high schools

This page could be used for an introduction to the project. To be completed by the school which has the details of those teachers and students who will be particpating in the program. 

Maybe a little bit of information about each student and what they want to get out of the program or why they chose to participate
